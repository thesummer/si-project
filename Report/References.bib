@article{Watters2006,
abstract = {A hemispheric dichotomy on Mars is marked by the sharp contrast between the sparsely cratered northern lowland plains and the heavily cratered southern highlands. Mechanisms proposed to remove ancient crust or form younger lowland crust include one or more giant impacts, subcrustal transport by mantle convection, the generation of thinner crust by plate tectonics, and mantle overturn following solidification of an early magma ocean. The age of the northern lowland crust is a significant constraint on these models. The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft is providing new constraints on the martian subsurface. Here we show evidence of buried impact basins ranging in diameter from about 130 km to 470 km found over approximately 14 per cent of the northern lowlands. The number of detected buried basins >200 km in diameter indicates that the lowland crust is ancient, dating back to the Early Noachian 
epoch. This crater density is a lower limit because of the likelihood that not all buried basins in the area surveyed by MARSIS have been detected. An Early Noachian age for the lowland crust has been previously suggested on the basis of a large number of quasi-circular topographic depressions interpreted to be evidence of buried basins. Only a few of these depressions in the area surveyed by MARSIS, however, correlate with the detected subsurface echoes. On the basis of the MARSIS data, we conclude that the northern lowland crust is at least as old as the oldest exposed highland crust. This suggests that the crustal dichotomy formed early in the geologic evolution of Mars.},

@article{Schenk2001,
abstract = {Large regions of the jovian moon Ganymede have been resurfaced, but the means has been unclear. Suggestions have ranged from volcanic eruptions of liquid water or solid ice to tectonic deformation, but definitive high-resolution morphological evidence has been lacking. Here we report digital elevation models of parts of the surface of Ganymede, derived from stereo pairs combining data from the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft, which reveal bright, smooth terrains that lie at roughly constant elevations 100 to 1,000 metres below the surrounding rougher terrains. These topographic data, together with new images that show fine-scale embayment and burial of older features, indicate that the smooth terrains were formed by flooding of shallow structural troughs by low-viscosity water-ice lavas. The oldest and most deformed areas (the 'reticulate' terrains) in general have the highest relative elevations, whereas units of the most common resurfaced type--the grooved terrain--lie at elevations between 
those of the smooth and reticulate terrains. Bright terrain, which accounts for some two-thirds of the surface, probably results from a continuum of processes, including crustal rifting, shallow flooding and groove formation. Volcanism plays an integral role in these processes, and is consistent with partial melting of Ganymede's interior.},
