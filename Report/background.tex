\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%
This is the \ac{GIPER} instrument proposal in answer to the \ac{ESA} \ac{AO}\cite{JUICE_AO} for the \ac{JUICE} mission. An \ac{IPR} is part of the Model Payload suggested by the  JUICE Science Study Team\cite{yellowbook}. This document will show that the \ac{GIPER} instrument will be able to provide high profile scientific investigations that are in accordance with the scientific and technical requirements of the \ac{JUICE} mission.
%
\subsection{JUICE Mission Overview}
The \ac{JUICE} mission is an \ac{ESA} L1 class science mission selected in May 2012 as part of the \ac{ESA} "Cosmic Vision" programme. The \ac{JUICE} mission originated from a reformulation of the EJSM-Laplace mission into a European-led mission. The mission is scheduled for launch in 2022 and arrival at Jupiter in 2030 where it will be inserted into a Jupiter orbit. It will include numerous flybys of Callisto, two Europa flybys, insertion into circular Ganymede orbits of three different altitudes and eventually de-orbit onto the Ganymede surface.

%This mission assumes that an altimeter instrument is included in the JUICE mission scientific instrument package. Altimeter is needed to estimate the surface clutter and surface slope.

\section{Summary of Instrument Interfaces}
%data, mechanical, power, EMC, thermal,
An important requirement is to have the antenna always directed parallel to the ground during the measurements with accuracy of $\pm 5$\textdegree. Concerning yaw, a deviation from parallel to the ground should be less than 1\textdegree. It is also important to have a small roll ($<10$\textdegree) in order to have the maximum antenna beam pattern size at nadir \cite{yellowbook}.

\section{On-ground and In-flight Test and Calibration}

\end{floatingfigure}
%
The \ac{GIPER} instrument will undergo a series of development and qualification tests to ensure that the instrument functions correctly and that it will achieve its scientific objectives. 
%
%
The required test facilities include \ac{EMC} lab, RF lab, Thermal-Vacuum chamber, vibration and shock testing and a \ac{GIPER} raw signal simulator. Some test facilities are available within the \ac{GIPER} instrument group, some will be provided by the Swedish space industry and consortium partners. The instrument will require tests at ESA's \ac{RF} labs for testing of the \ac{GIPER} antenna radiation characteristics. A complete instrument test overview is shown in Table \ref{tab:instrument_testing}.

%
\subsection{EGSE}
A raw signal simulator will be developed by the \ac{GIPER} instrument group. This raw signal simulator will be similar to the one developed for the \ac{SHARAD} instrument\cite{Giovanni} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:MEGS} and allow testing of the signal processing chain and to develop a Ganymede transfer function considering the orbit altitude and surface clutter and sub-surface dielectric interfaces. After launch of the JUICE satellite, the \ac{GIPER} \ac{EGSE} will be located at the JUICE \ac{MOC}. A set of calibration files and algorithms will also be send to the JUICE \ac{SOC} for processing of the raw instrument data into L1b data.
%
%
\subsection{In-Flight Calibration}
As was done for the SHARAD instrument\cite{SHARAD_ppt}, two types of in-flight calibrations are planned. An internal calibration is performed by directly looping a transmitted signal to the receiver and sending the raw unprocessed data to ground. An external calibration is performed by transmitting signals onto a flat surface region of Ganymede, receiving the echo and sending the unprocessed data to ground. These calibrations will be performed once the radar antenna has been successfully deployed.
%
%
\section{System Level Assembly, Integration and Verification}
%
Verification by testing will be the main method of verification for the \ac{GIPER} instrument. Other means of verification are analyses and mathematical models.  
%
\subsection{Requirements}
Of special concern to the \ac{GIPER} instrument performance and degradation is the intense radiation of high energy electrons which may affect the instrument electronics. Testing and verification must ensure that the instrument will meet its full operational performance when it enters its primary scientific operation phase at the spacecraft Ganymede orbit insertion ten years after launch.
%
\subsection{Deliverable Models}
%
Three instrument models will be delivered to ESA:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \ac{STM} - For testing of the instrument structural and thermal interface to the spacecraft\\
\item \ac{EM} - To test and verify that the instrument meets the functional and technical requirements.\\
\item \ac{PFM} - will be build using full flight standard components and tested at qualification levels and at acceptance durations. This will ensure that the specified instrument performance is met in accordance to the space environment found around Jupiter.
\end{itemize}
%
Before building of the \ac{PFM} is initiated, a dedicated \ac{QM} will be build and tested at qualification level. This unit can then later be refurbished as a \ac{FS} in case this deems necessary.

\section{Flight Operations Concept}
%operational modes, calibrations, 
%
The instrument modes are inherited from the SHARAD instrument\cite{SHARAD_ppt}.
%
\subsection{Nominal Operations}
%
Four nominal operation modes are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low data rate
\item High data rate
\item Calibration
\item Receive only
\end{itemize}
%
\subsection{Other Modes}
%
Two silent modes are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item Off - all equipments turned off
\item Heating - only heaters are powered on
\end{itemize}
%
Additionally, four support modes are defined: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check/init
\item Standby
\item Warm-up
\item Idle
\end{itemize}

\section{Science Ground Segment Concept}
This section describes the preliminary expected GIPER contributions to the JUICE \ac{SGS}. These will later be further specified in the \ac{GIPER} \ac{SIP}.
%
\subsection{Implementation Concept for the Science Ground Segment}
A dedicated \ac{GIPER} \ac{SOG} will be established at LTU, Kiruna as has been done on previous instruments from \ac{IRF}\cite{ASPERA_PO}. %
%
\subsection{Planning of Payload Operations}
The \ac{GIPER} \ac{SOG} will provide the necessary support to the JUICE \ac{SOC} in preparation of the instrument science operations planning and scheduling.
%
\subsection{On-Board Software Maintenance}
During instrument commissioning and critical operation phases, the \ac{GIPER} \ac{SOG} may be relocated to the JUICE \ac{MOC} established at ESOC or \ac{SOC} at ESAC along with the \ac{EGSE}. 
%
%
\section{Data Reduction, Scientific Analysis and Archival Plans}
%
It is expected that housekeeping data and science data will be sent from the JUICE \ac{MOC}, via internet, to the \ac{GIPER} \ac{SOG} in LTU, Kiruna. Here data will be reduced, archived and distributed to other science teams including the JUICE science data archive. To correctly remove surface clutter signals, it is required to have simultaneously data from the altimeter instrument. 
%
A Quick-Look data analyser software will be developed, to optimise efficiency and scientific return of instrument operations.
%
A software tool will also be developed to analyse and convert L1b raw data values (un-calibrated science data) into L2/L3 data files.
%
