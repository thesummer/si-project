\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%
The GIPER instrument consortium answer to the ESA \ac{AO}\cite{JUICE_AO} for the L1 class \ac{JUICE} mission.

\section{Technical Description and Design}
%
The proposed instrument has been designed in accordance to ESA \ac{EID-A} for the \ac{JUICE} mission\cite{EIDA}.

\subsection{Design Overview}
\subsection{Instrument Design Elements}
\subsection{Technical Resources}
\subsection{Instrument Spacecraft Requirements}
%thermal, power, mechanical mounting, EMC, especially radiation sensitive parts, radiation shielding and mitigation strategy, flight heritage of hardware, ressource budgets, 
This mission assumes that an altimeter instrument is included in the JUICE mission scientific instrument package. Altimeter is needed to estimate the surface clutter and surface slope.

\section{Summary of Instrument Interfaces}
%data, mechanical, power, EMC, thermal,
%
\section{On-ground and In-flight Test and Calibration}
%test equipment requirements (i.e. thermal vacuum chamber, EMC labs etc.), EGSE, radar signal simulator(test of ground processing chain),
%
Functional, EMC, Thermal-Vacuum, Vibration.
%
%
For \ac{EGSE} a \ac{GIPER} raw signal simulator will be developed by the instrument consortia. The raw signal simulator will be similar to the one developed for the \ac{SHARAD} instrument\cite{Giovanni} and allow testing of the signal processing chain and to develop a Ganymede transfer function considering the orbit altitude and surface clutter and sub-surface dielectric interfaces.

\subsection{Requirements}
\subsection{Deliverable Models}
%
Two models of the proposed instrument will be developed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Engineering Model - To test and verify the instruments functional and technical requirements as well as the instrument performance.\\
\item Protoflight Model - will be build using full flight standard components and tested at qualification levels.
\end{itemize}

\section{Flight Operations Concept}
%operational modes, calibrations, 
%
The instrument modes are inherited from the SHARAD instrument\cite{SHARAD_ppt}.
%
\subsection{Nominal Operations}
%
Operation modes: Low data rate, high data rate, calibration, receive only
%
\subsection{Other Modes}
%
Silent Modes: Off, Heating
Support modes: Check/init, standby, warm-up, idle
%
%
%
\section{Science Ground Segment Concept}
%operations requests, on-board software maintenance (test facilities to generate and test update)
%Further described in the Science Implementation Plan (SIP) - answer to SIRD
